Linux executes shell scripts and programs differently from Windows. Common usage patterns:

Make a script executable and run it:

chmod +x ./script.sh
./script.sh


Run a shell script with sh:

sh filename.sh


Execute Python modules or scripts:

python3 script.py
python3 -m modulename


Always prefer ./filename (with a proper executable bit) or invoking an interpreter explicitly (sh, bash, python3) to ensure predictable behavior.
