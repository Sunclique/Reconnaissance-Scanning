# Reconnaissance-Scanning
Purpose. This document is a concise but detailed operational guide for basic information-gathering and scanning tasks used during the reconnaissance stage of an ethical-hacking engagement. It is written as a reference for practitioners who want clear commands, rationale, and practical notes suitable for inclusion in a GitHub repository. All commands shown are for Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS). Use only on systems and networks for which you have explicit authorization.
